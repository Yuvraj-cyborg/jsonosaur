Ok so :

first thing first, we need to know what all types JSON usually contains - 
1. Null (ofc)
2. True
3. False
4. Number (int, float, yada yada)
5. String
6. Object
7. Array

Mmmmm but the fact is I need one space to keep all these type of data whenever tthey come, for say there's a variable A it can hold any of the above data types without manual unsafe casting or anything, it should be during the runtime, because you(whoever is parsing a json) never know what it contains...

1 thing gets clear, we will know the type in compile time...Am unsure but yea.

So after a bit of surfing on web,we can use Union(certainly), but we also need to define the labels beforehand, indeed we going for "Enums". 
we can have 7 enums like JsonNum, JsonStr, etc. 

So Union would only store whatever comes but to know what is comming it will use enum's label.

Enum label -> Union 
Would be writing it in comments again !

You fear Union ?? Me too feared and hence had
an alternative approach to it
that was why not have (type, index) pair instead of (union, enum)
like 7 diff types to pick from, and maybe 7 diff variables ??
but its very dumb, cuz imagine in ur code there would be stuff like 
if (string) -> str_store(index) and shit like that. So yea this bad thought I had but yea I googled a bit and asked Grok, and my take is certainly so bad (only in case of JSON parsing) it can be used at other places efficiently.

Anyways,
